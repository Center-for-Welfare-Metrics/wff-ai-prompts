# 🔬 AI Prompts — Pain-Atlas

This directory will contain prompts for **Pain-Atlas**, the tool that visualizes and standardizes scientific evidence on pain intensity, duration, and distribution across species and procedures.

Prompts here will eventually handle:
- Interpretation of scientific studies  
- Extraction of pain parameters  
- Harmonization of methodologies  
- Integration with species-specific biological models
