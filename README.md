# 🌱 Welfare Footprint Framework — AI Prompts Repository  
### `wff-ai-prompts`

This repository contains the **complete collection of AI prompts** used across all software tools in the **Welfare Footprint Framework (WFF)**.  
It is publicly accessible to support:

- scientific transparency  
- public and peer review  
- collaborative refinement  
- error reporting and prompt debugging  
- reproducible workflows  

This repo contains **only prompt files** (text templates, fragments, glossaries) — *no code and no system secrets*.

## 🔍 Why this repository exists

As the WFF ecosystem expands, multiple tools rely on increasingly sophisticated AI prompts:

- 🥚 **Food Welfare Scanner App**  
- 📊 **WelfareData.org**  
- 🧠 **Hedonic-Track GPT**  
- 🐝 **Pain-Atlas**  
- 🕸️ **Welfare Footprint Graph (WFG)**  
- 🗺️ **Processogram visual systems**  
- 🐓 Species-level welfare analyses  
- 🔬 Evidence classification & mapping tools  

Keeping these prompts scattered across private folders or embedded inside code increases the risk of:

- outdated prompts  
- conflicting versions  
- unclear provenance  
- confusion about which prompt belongs to which tool  
- difficulty discussing improvements with non-coders  

This repository solves all of that.

# 🗂️ Repository Structure

Prompts are organized by **tool** (product/module) rather than by AI function.  
This keeps everything intuitive even as the ecosystem grows.
